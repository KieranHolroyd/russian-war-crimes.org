Obviously this is going to take a tremendous amount of effort, but it's work worth doing.
I honestly don't have a plan or even a web stack in mind for this project, other than I want it to run on cloudflare pages, and be easily updated by anyone even without much knowledge of programming.
If you want to help in any way, feel free to contact me.
